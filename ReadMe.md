# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)
## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
### Website Requirements
The website will consist of 7 pages in total, including:

- A landing page containing:
  - An explanation of the project.
  - Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

- Four visualization pages, each with:
  - A descriptive title and heading tag.
  - The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  - A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

- A "Comparisons" page that:
  - Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  - Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
  - The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

- A "Data" page that:
  - Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
 
 The website, at the top of every page will have a navigation menu that:
 * Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
 * Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
 * Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
 * Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change).
